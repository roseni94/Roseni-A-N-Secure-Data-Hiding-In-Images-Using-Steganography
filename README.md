An Encryption and Decryption Tool Based on Steganography 🔐
Summary
This project is a tool that uses steganography to conceal and retrieve confidential communications from pictures. By employing Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding to insert encrypted text within images, it offers a secure method of sending sensitive data.

Features 
✅ Encrypt & Decrypt Messages: Safely conceal private information within pictures.
✅ Passcode Protection: This makes sure that only people with permission can access secret messages.
✅ User-Friendly GUI (Tkinter) – Modern, dark-themed interface with intuitive controls.
✅ Error Handling & Notifications – Instant feedback on encryption/decryption status.
✅ Secure & Lightweight – Uses Python & OpenCV for fast and efficient processing.

Technologies Used
Python – Core language for encryption and decryption.
Tkinter – GUI for user-friendly interaction.
OpenCV is a program that processes images to extract and embed hidden messages.
NumPy: Numerical computations optimized.

Installation & Setup
1.Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/steganography-tool.git
cd steganography-tool

2.Install Dependencies
pip install opencv-python numpy tkinter

3.Run the Application
python encrypt.py

Usage:
1.Message Encryption
Add a picture.
Enter the passcode and secret message.
Select "Encrypt" to make the message in the picture invisible.
2.Message Decryption
Upload the picture that has been encrypted.
Enter the passcode correctly.
Press "Decrypt" to make the concealed message visible.

Future Scope 🚀 
🔹 AI-Powered Steganography: Use machine learning to improve security.
🔹 Blockchain Integration: Decentralized storage of concealed communications.
🔹 IoT Security: Employ steganography to provide secure IoT communications. 
🔹 Live Video Steganography: conceal messages while streaming in real time.
